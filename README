This directory is used to create a virtual machine that runs on either
VMware or Digital Ocean.
 Fusion (for the mac) with
Centos[1] in that VM.  It uses packer[2] to that.

Prior to running the makefile you'll need to have:
- installed packer
- downloaded the CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso for Centos[3]

Obviously, if your using VMware Fusion you'll need to have that installed.

If you using Digital Ocean you will need to put your account credentials in
digitalocean-credentials.json.  Something like this.
{
    "digitalocean_client_id": "BlahBlahBlahBar",
    "digitalocean_api_key": "BlahBlahBlahBlahFoo"
}
Digital Ocean is quite cheap so building one of these will cost you only
a few cents each time.  But if you don't delete the snapshot they will
charge you a monthly fee to keep it around.

Put CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso into iso/CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso.

You will want to tinker with provisions/initialize-users.sh so the first users
isn't bhyde.  In particular note there how the .ssh/authorized_keys is setup.

You may wish to tinker with
- template.json+ -- which tells packer what to do.
- http_directory/anaconda-ks.cfg which tells CentOS's kickstarter[4] how to
  setup the machine - this effects only the VMWare VM.
- change the centos mirror used in both those
- tinker which what provisioners are used at the bottom of template.json+
  For example may not want ccl (a common lisp implementation), etc. etc.

At that point just do
  $ make digitalocean
or 
  $ make vmware-iso
and cross your fingers.

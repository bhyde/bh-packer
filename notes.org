* Issues
** need to review the anaconda script to be sure it's minimal
** ntpd, apache, nodejs, etherpad-lite, n2n/edge, spdyproxy, gpg
** mail forwarding
** SL v.s. centos
** better scheme for the configuration of users
** better scheme for adjusting what to provision
* VMWARE issues
** sometimes the mac machine locks up and I have to powercycle!
** sometimes I can't shutdown a guest, i have to power it down.
** deleting VM is wonky, the pattern doesn't seem dependable.
* CCL
** ccl.tgz is full of stuff we don't use, so could be pruned

** ccl.tgz should be hosted someplace more durable/public
** instructions for making ccl.tgz are missing.
* Emacs
** encrypted files are useless due to sensitive changes to gpg
